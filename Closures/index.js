/* 
Challenge: 
    1. Write a function that simulates a simple bank account. 
       The function should store the balance and enable users  
       to deposit money, withdraw money, and check the balance.

Requirements:

- The account balance should start at zero.

- The function should return an object containing 
  3 functions. One for depositing money, one for 
  withdrawing money, and a getBalance function which 
  logs the balance and the account holder's name.

- Deposits should add to the balance, and withdrawals should subtract 
  from it.
